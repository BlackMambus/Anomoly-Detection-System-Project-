# Anomoly-Detection-System-Project-

The Anomaly Detection System is a robust data analysis and machine learning project designed to identify irregular patterns, behaviors, or values in datasets that deviate significantly from the norm. These "anomalies" often represent critical insights‚Äîranging from fraud detection, system failures, cybersecurity threats, or medical abnormalities.

üß† Core Objectives
Detect outliers or abnormal events across varied domains (finance, health, networks).

Ensure real-time flagging and reporting of suspicious activities.

Minimize false positives and maintain high accuracy.

‚öôÔ∏è Key Components
Data Collection Module: Gathers structured or unstructured data from relevant sources.

Preprocessing Layer: Cleanses, transforms, and normalizes the input data.

Detection Algorithms: Employs statistical models, clustering methods, or machine learning (e.g., Isolation Forests, Autoencoders, SVM) to detect anomalies.

Visualization Dashboard: Displays flagged anomalies with timestamps, severity levels, and context.

Alert System: Sends automated notifications via email, SMS, or system popups.
